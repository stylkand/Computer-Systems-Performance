## ðŸ“‹**Description**

This repository contains workload performance analysis for two server-like systems.

## **Details**
The first one is a simple simulation of a server-database and it's final performance evaluation was accomplished using Java Modelling Tools.

The second one is a simulation of a server queue system fully implemented and evaluated in python.
